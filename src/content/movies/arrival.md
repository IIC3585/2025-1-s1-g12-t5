Adapted by Eric Heisserer from Ted Chiang’s “Story of Your Life,” *Arrival* masterfully blends a reverse‑chronology twist with themes of communication, grief, and non‑linear time. It explores how language shapes cognition, referencing the Sapir‑Whorf hypothesis, and uses the palindrome motif of “Hannah” to mirror its circular structure. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
